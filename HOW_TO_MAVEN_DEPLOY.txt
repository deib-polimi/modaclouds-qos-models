Add your authentication information to ~/.m2/settings.xml so that the github site-maven-plugin can push to github:

<!-- NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT settings.xml IS NOT WORLD READABLE! -->
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>github</id>
      <username>YOUR-USERNAME</username>
      <password>YOUR-PASSWORD</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>

(As noted, please make sure to chmod 700 settings.xml to ensure no one can read your password in the file. If someone knows how to make site-maven-plugin prompt for a password instead of requiring it in a config file, let me know.)

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO SET <merge>true</merge> IN YOUR site-maven-plugin CONFIGURATION, OTHERWISE THE DEPLOY WILL OVERRITE THE ENTIRE MAVEN REPO

Now run: mvn clean deploy
