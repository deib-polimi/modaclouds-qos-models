The first time you want to publish your javadoc you need to create the gh-pages branch.
Run this sequence of commands in a temporary folder:

$ git clone https://github.com/<user>/<repository>.git
$ cd <repository>
$ git checkout --orphan gh-pages
$ git rm -rf .
$ echo "My GitHub Page" > index.html
$ git add index.html
$ git commit -a -m "First pages commit"
$ git push origin gh-pages

IMPORTANT: Remember to check 'github.repository.name' and 'github.user.name' properties in your pom.xml so to match your repo and user name.

Then go to your project root folder and run:

$ mvn clean javadoc:javadoc scm-publish:publish-scm

to publish your javadoc, which will be available at
http://<user>.github.io/<repository>/
