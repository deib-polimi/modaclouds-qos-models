MODAClouds QoS Models
==========================

In the context of MODAClouds European project (www.modaclouds.eu), Politecnico was
one of the partners involved in the development of the QoS Analysis and Monitoring Tools.

The QoS Models is a library containing all metamodels necessary to describe qos-constraints, monitoring rules
and monitoring ontology together with their java representation.

Please refer to deliverable [D6.3.2](http://www.modaclouds.eu/publications/public-deliverables/) 
to understand the role of this component in the MODAClouds Monitoring Platform.

Additional Features:
- Serialization and deserialization between XML and Java objects.
- automatic generation of monitoring rules from qos constraints
- validation of monitoring rules
